Credit Card Customer Analysis

Project Description
This project involves the analysis of credit card customer data to identify patterns and insights. The analysis covers various aspects such as revenue by expense type, total revenue generated by state, average annual fees by age group, and the most common card categories by age group. Additionally, the project implements a machine learning model to predict revenue based on customer demographics.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
PostgreSQL
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-customer-analysis.git
cd credit-card-customer-analysis
Install the required Python packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your PostgreSQL database:

Create a database named CC_Analysis.

Import your tables (cc_detail and cust_detail) into the database.
Configure your database connection:

Update the db_params dictionary in your script with your PostgreSQL credentials:

python
db_params = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'database': 'CC_Analysis',
    'user': 'your_postgres_user',
    'password': 'your_postgres_password'
}



bash

python script_name.py
This will connect to your PostgreSQL database, fetch the data, perform the analysis, and display the visualizations.

Predict revenue for new customer data:

After running the script, you can use the interactive function to predict revenue based on new customer data:

python

predict_revenue()
You will be prompted to enter the customer's age, gender, job, and income, and the script will output the predicted revenue.
